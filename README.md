# Pathfinding-Pro
An advanced, high-performance implementation of the A* algorithm for Unity.  
Built with JobSystem + Burst for maximum speed and scalability.

## ‚ú® Features:

- **Multi-threaded pathfinding**: Parallel path calculation with Unity JobSystem + Burst.
- **Grid-threaded creation**: Supports multithread creation of the grid.
- **Grid-based navigation**: Supports 2D.
- **Optimized memory usage**: Precomputed grids stored and reused for different agents.
- **Custom Native Priority Queue**: High-performance open list implementation.
- **Scalable performance**: Tested with 300+ agents in a 280x115 grid (‚âà 30,200 nodes).
- **Schedules Requests**: Request paths without blocking the main thread.
- **Weighted paths**: Supports different movement costs per node for more realistic navigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap
- **Multi-level support**
- **Dynamic obstacles**
- **RVO / ORCA local avoidance**
- **3D volumetric navigation**
- **Agent-size awareness**
- **(Optional) RVO integration**.
